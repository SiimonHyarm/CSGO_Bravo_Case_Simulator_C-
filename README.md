# CSGO_Bravo_Case_Simulator_C-
I am trying to turn my Python variant of this into a C# WindowsForm application. It's for studying purposes. 

05.12.2020 I have created the system for the Bravo case. It is a bit hardcoded, but it does the job relatively fast and gives you a random weapon, with random quality, type and wear.
This is also written to the console. The process of generating the price depending on the weapon and type is done in another class Price.
